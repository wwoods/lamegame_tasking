lamegame_tasking

Packages provided:
  lgTask

Dependencies:
  pymongo

Summary:
lamegame_tasking provides a self-organizing task processing framework.  The central database is a mongoDb instance.

Note that all tasks run in threads in a single process.

Example usage:
Programming a task (must be in a file in tasks directory):
class MyAppTask(lgTask.Task):
    def run(taskDb, arg, **kwargs):
        # Pass mongodb:// conn string to get a pymongo collection, database,
        # or connection (based on the URL).  This is parameter magic that can
        # be overridden
        taskDb['collection'].insert({ 'arg': arg })
        self.taskConnection.createTask(
          "MyAppTask"
          , taskDb=taskDb
          , arg=arg + 1
          )



Programming a task that should abort if an instance is already running:
class MyAppSingleton(lgTask.SingletonTask):
    def run(**kwargs):
        # ...Normal run function

The task is singleton'd based on the "taskName" parameter, which for classes 
defaults to the class name.  If you have e.g. a per-database singleton, simply 
make scheduling or creating the task extract the database name and initialize 
"taskName" accordingly.



Creating a sample task to run:
>> import lgTask
>> c = lgTask.Connection()
>> c.createTask("MyAppTask"[, taskName="MyAppTaskAltName"], arg="Hello, world!")



Creating a single-scheduled task to run:
>> import lgTask
>> c = lgTask.Connection()
>> c.createTask("MyAppTask", runAt=[datetime object OR "1 day/hour/minute/second"], arg="Delayed!")



Create a recurring scheduled task (remember, not specifying taskName as a kwarg
will default to the class name for the task):
>> import lgTask
>> c = lgTask.Connection()
>> c.scheduleTask("MyAppTask", interval="1 day/hour/minute/second"[, runAt=[datetime object OR "1 day/hour/minute/second"])

The runAt parameter may be used to defer the task's interval start time from 
NOW until the specified time (think of it as startAt; named runAt for 
consistency).

If a scheduled task with the same name already exists, this will raise an
exception rather than rewriting that task's schedule / kwargs.



Create a single-scheduled task to run ONLY IF it isn't already scheduled:
>> c.scheduleTask("MyAppTask", runAt='1 hour')

If the task was already scheduled (and not executed yet), this function does 
nothing; that task is presumed to cover whatever this newly requested task
is supposed to accomplish.  Be careful with that.  But this is mostly for
batching things when batches are gradually built in the db.



Unscheduling a scheduled task:
>> c.unscheduleTask("MyAppTask")

Does not raise an exception if the task does not exist.



Configuring and running processors for development:
At the beginning of your app's web server / task generator:

>> import lgTask
>> processor = lgTask.Processor("/path/to/config"[, taskName="myProcessor"])
>> processor.start()

This will spawn the processor in a new thread.  If you want to specify the 
config in code, you can pass a dict or lgTask.lib.reprconf.Config object 
instead of a file path.  

If you want to block on the processor until it can no longer consume any
tasks, use:

>> processor.stop(onNoTasksToConsume=True)



Configuring and running processors for production:
1. Symlink lamegame_tasking/bin/lgTaskProcessor to your PATH (or execute directly)

2. Setup a user to run the task processors; in their home directory, check out your task source code and dependencies.

2. Setup a configuration file for your deployment, like the following (myAppProcessor.cfg):

[taskProcessor] # This name is required; on the bright side, this allows you
                # to put other configuration items in the file
taskDatabase = 'mongodb://[user:password]@server:port[/mytaskdb]'
taskDir = '/home/user/myAppTasks'
[taskName = name [defaults to hostname]]

3. Setup cron to run lgTaskProcessor every minute (to prevent it from erroring out; a processor will automatically not run two instances) with the following parameters:
  a. Config file - absolute path to task processor configuration
  b. [optional] Processor name - if unspecified, the config or host name is 
      used.
  z. Example: lgTaskProcessor /home/user/myAppProcessor.cfg [processor1]
